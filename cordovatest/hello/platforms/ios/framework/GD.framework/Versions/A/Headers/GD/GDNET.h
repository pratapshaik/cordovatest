/** NSURLCache category with additional features.
 * 
 * This class is a category of the native <tt>NSURLCache</tt> class that adds
 * the functions documented below to the interface. The additional
 * functions can be used when the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure
 * is in use in the
 * URL Loading System, see \ref GDURLLoadingSystem, or in the URL session
 * system, see \ref nsurlsession_support.
 *
 * This class provides additional features to the default cache.
 *
 * This documentation includes only additional operations that are not part
 * of the default <tt>NSURLCache</tt> interface.
 *
 * Note that the additional features cannot be used when the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * proxy infrastructure isn't in use, even if temporarily. If the functions are
 * called in this state, they have no effect.

/** Allow or disallow Kerberos delegation.
 * 
 * Call this function to allow or disallow Kerberos delegation within
 * BlackBerry Dynamics secure communications. By default, Kerberos delegation is
 * disallowed.
 *
 * If Kerberos delegation is allowed, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime behaves as
 * follows.
 * - Kerberos requests will be for tickets that can be delegated.
 * - Application servers that are trusted for delegation can be sent tickets
 *   that can be delegated, if such tickets were issued.
 * .
 *
 * If Kerberos delegation isn't allowed, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime behaves
 * as follows.
 * - Kerberos requests won't be for tickets that can be delegated.
 * - Application servers won't be sent tickets that can be delegated, even if
 *   such tickets were issued.
 * .
 *
 * After this function has been called, delegation will remain allowed or
 * disallowed until this function is called again with a different setting.
 *
 * Note: User and service configuration in the Kerberos Key Distribution Center
 * (KDC), typically a Microsoft Active Directory server, is required in order
 * for delegation to be successful. On its own, calling this function won't make
 * Kerberos delegation work in the whole end-to-end application.
 *
 * When this function is called, the Kerberos ticket and credentials caches
 * will be cleared. I.e. there is an effective call to the
 * \reflink GDCacheController::clearCredentialsForMethod:
 * clearCredentialsForMethod:\endlink
 * function with an <tt>NSURLAuthenticationMethodNegotiate</tt> parameter.
 *
 * @param allow <tt>YES</tt> to allow delegation, <tt>NO</tt> to disallow.
