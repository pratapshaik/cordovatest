`BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base`

How to set up
=============
Use of the BlackBerry Dynamics Cordova plugins is dependent on the BlackBerry
Dynamics Software Development Kit (SDK). Before setting up the Base plugin,
install the SDK for Android, or the SDK for iOS, or both.

To set up the Base plugin, first install the special BlackBerry Dynamics Cordova
Configure plugin. The Configure plugin makes changes to the Base plugin so that
it can be added to your Cordova projects.

The changes made by the Configure plugin include setting the paths of the home
directories of the SDKs for Android and iOS into the Base plugin.

There are several options for installing the Configure plugin.

-   Don't specify any SDK paths, as follows:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
    ```

    The Configure plugin will then attempt to determine automatically the
    installed paths of the SDK for Android and the SDK for iOS. This is the
    easiest option, if you have installed both the SDKs, and in their default
    locations.

    The Configure plugin assumes the following installed paths.

    -   For the SDK for Android, the default location if installed using the
        Android SDK Manager tool at the following paths:

        for Apple macOS:

        -   `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` (RECOMMENDED OPTION)  
        OR  
        `$ANDROID_HOME` (DEPRICATED NOW)  
        `/extras/blackberry/dynamics_sdk/m2repository/`

        for Microsoft Windows:

        -   `%ANDROID_SDK_ROOT%` (RECOMMENDED OPTION)  
        OR  
        `%ANDROID_HOME%` (DEPRICATED NOW)  
        `\extras\blackberry\dynamics_sdk\m2repository\`

        At least one of `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` or `ANDROID_HOME` environment variables must be set when the Configure
        plugin is installed.

        Also please note, that `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is depricated and its support might be removed in future versions, so it is recommended to use `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` instead.

    -   For the SDK for iOS, the default installer location, which is:
        "~/Library/Application Support/BlackBerry/Good.platform/iOS/Frameworks/GD.framework".

-   Specify an explicit path for the SDK for Android, or for the SDK for iOS, or
    for both, as follows.

    Explicit path for both:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
        --variable bbdSDKForAndroid="/Users/<user>/Downloads/gdsdk-release-<version>/m2repository"
        --variable bbdSDKForiOS="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GD.framework"
    ```
    (The command above and all the following commands in this section have been
    split across multiple lines for readability.)

    The Configure plugin will attempt to determine automatically any path that
    isn't specified.

    Explicit path for Android, automatic path for iOS:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
        --variable bbdSDKForAndroid="/Users/<user>/Downloads/gdsdk-release-<version>/m2repository"
    ```

    Explicit path for iOS, automatic path for Android:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
        --variable bbdSDKForiOS="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GD.framework"
    ```

-   Specify that one or other SDK isn't installed, as follows.

    Specify that the SDK for Android isn't installed:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
        --variable bbdSDKForiOS="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GD.framework"
        --variable bbdSDKForAndroid=""
    ```

    Specify that the SDK for iOS isn't installed:
    ```
    cordova plugin add <path_to_package>/BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-configure
        --variable bbdSDKForAndroid="/Users/<user>/Downloads/gdsdk-release-<version>/m2repository"
        --variable bbdSDKForiOS=""
    ```

    Setting bbdSDKForAndroid or bbdSDKForiOS to be empty makes no changes to the
    Base plugin for that SDK. Use this option if you want to develop a Cordova application on only
    one platform, or if you have only one of the BlackBerry Dynamics SDKs installed.

Note
====
BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Cordova now uses AAR version of binaries from BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Android which is located in local `m2repository` after download is completed manually or via Android Studio.
To be backwards compatible both `"/Users/<user>/Downloads/gdsdk-release-<version>/m2repository"` and `"/Users/<user>/Downloads/gdsdk-release-<version>/sdk"` are valid values for `bbdSDKForAndroid` variable. Configure plugin is looking for the `m2repository` folder, but if you pass variant with `sdk` folder we will do some manipulations and convert it to `m2repository`. 

Custom `Activity` subclass
==========================================
The plugin provides an `Activity` subclass `com.good.gd.cordova.core.MainActivity` which is subclass of `BBDCordovaActivity` that, in turn, extends `CordovaActivity`.

`com.good.gd.cordova.core.MainActivity` is, by default, the main activity in Cordova application for Android.

In a case you want to use your custom `CordovaActivity` subclass, it should extend our `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaActivity` to guarantee right integration with BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Android.
Also, to avoid merging issues of Cordova configuration files you should do one of following options:
-   remove appropriate `edit-config` tag in `<app>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base/plugin.xml` and define your own in root `config.xml` with your custom `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaActivity` subclass
-   in appropriate `edit-config` tag in `<app>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base/plugin.xml` replace `com.good.gd.cordova.core.MainActivity` with your custom `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaActivity` subclass

Second option is probably easier.
After this is done it might be necessary to run `cordova prepare` command to get your changes applied. 

Custom `Application` subclass
==========================================
The plugin provides `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaApp` which is an `Application` subclass and is, by default, the main `Application` class in Cordova application for Android. 

In a case you decided to use some custom `Application` subclass, this class should extend `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaApp` to guarantee right integration with BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Android.
Also, to avoid merging issues of Cordova configuration files you should do one of following options:
-   remove appropriate `edit-config` tag in `<app>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base/plugin.xml` and define your own in root `config.xml` with your custom `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaApp` subclass
-   in appropriate `edit-config` tag in `<app>/plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base/plugin.xml` replace `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaApp` with your custom `com.good.gd.cordova.core.BBDCordovaApp` subclass

Second option is probably easier.
After this is done it might be necessary to run `cordova prepare` command to get your changes applied. 

Custom preferences for BlackBerry Dynamics
==========================================
A number of custom preferences are supported by this plugin. The preferences
correspond to BlackBerry Dynamics features in the SDKs for Android and iOS.

The usual Cordova system is followed for the specification of BlackBery Dynamics
preferences. Add a `preference` tag to the `config.xml` file in the Cordova
project directory for each preference being specified. Put the preference tags
in one of the following locations.

-   In the root `widget` tag, to set the preference for all platforms.
-   In the `platform` tag with `name="android"`, to set the preference for
    Android only.
-   In the `platform` tag with `name="ios"`, to set the preference for iOS only.

The custom preferences supported by this plugin are as follows.

-   Preference: Enterprise Simulation mode.

    To run your application in Enterprise Simulation mode, set the following
    preference.
    ```
    <preference name="GDEnterpriseSimulationMode" value="true" />
    ```

    For details of Enterprise Simulation mode, see either of the following pages
    in the reference documentation on the application developer portal.

    -   For Android: https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=enterprisesimulation.html&docType=android
    -   For iOS: https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=enterprisesimulation.html&docType=api

-   Preference: BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement identifier and version.

    To set the entitlement identifier and version of the application, set the
    following preferences.
    ```
    <preference name="GDApplicationID" value="com.yourdomain.yourentitlementid" />
    <!-- Following line sets entitlement version to 1.0.0.0 -->
    <preference name="GDApplicationVersion" value="1.0.0.0" />
    ```

    For best practice in setting these values, see either of the following pages
    on the application developer portal. Look for the Identification heading.

    -   For Android: https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=classcom_1_1good_1_1gd_1_1_g_d_android.html&docType=android
    -   For iOS: https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=interface_g_di_o_s.html&docType=api

-   Preference: Enterprise discovery URL scheme.

    To add the enterprise discovery URL scheme to your Cordova application for
    iOS, add the following preference.
    ```
    <preference name="BBD_Enterprise_Discovery" value="true" />
    ```

    The enterprise discovery URL scheme doesn't apply to Android. Set this
    preference in the platform tag for iOS.

    For details of the custom URL schemes utilised by BlackBerry Dynamics
    applications, see the following page in the reference documentation on the
    application developer portal.

    -   https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=_build_time_configuration.html&docType=api

    This preference corresponds to the URL scheme:
    `com.good.gd.discovery.enterprise`

-   Preference: Face ID usage declaration.

    Face ID is a facial recognition feature that is available on some iOS
    devices. The BlackBerry Dynamics management console has a policy setting by
    which the enterprise administrator can allow end users to authenticate using
    Face ID. All BlackBerry Dynamics iOS applications must therefore declare
    usage of the Face ID capability.

    For more background, see the following page on the application developer
    portal. Look for the Face ID heading.

    -   https://community.blackberry.com/view-doc.jspa?fileName=_build_time_configuration.html&docType=api

    The Base plugin can add a declaration of Face ID usage to your iOS
    application. It does this by inserting an `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`
    property, with value "Enables authentication without a password." into the
    Info.plist file.

    Adding the declaration is the default behaviour. It can be selected
    explicitly by setting the following preference in the root config.xml either
    globally or for iOS platform specifically.
    ```
    <preference name="addFaceIDUsage" value="On" />
    ```

    Automatic addition can be switched off by setting the following preference
    instead.
    ```
    <preference name="addFaceIDUsage" value="Off" />
    ```

    Don't switch off automatic addition unless your application uses Face ID for
    some other reason than BlackBerry Dynamics integration. In that case, you
    will already have a usage declaration, to which you should add a text like
    the above.

    The Base plugin doesn't add localized versions of the usage message
    automatically. This can be done manually, by adding InfoPlist.strings files
    in the usual way. This is described on the apple.com developer website
    here:

    -   https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html

Setting these preferences will result in corresponding changes to the
application declaration files: the `assets/settings.json` and
`AndroidManifest.xml` files, for Android, and the Info.plist file, for iOS. If
you don't use the preferences, you must change those files manually in order to
make use of the corresponding features.

Support for the "mailto:" URL scheme
====================================
The Base plugin supports use of RFC-2368 and RFC-6068, the "mailto:" URL scheme,
to initiate composition of email messages. The email client used for composition
will be a secure email service provider, such as BlackBerry Work, if available,
or a native application, if available and allowed by enterprise policy.

The Base plugin on its own doesn't support email attachments. The BlackBerry
Dynamics MailTo plugin (cordova-plugin-bbd-mailto) does support attachments.
That plugin is included in the BlackBerry Dynamics SDK for Cordova and can be
added to a Cordova project in the usual way.

Adding to a Cordova application
===============================
This plugin can be added to an application as follows, for example:
```
$ cd BlackBerry_Dynamics_SDK_for_Cordova_<version>
$ cordova create MyApp my.app.id App
$ cd MyApp

// optional, if needed 
$ npm install 

$ cordova platform add android
$ cordova platform add ios
$ cordova plugin add ../plugins/cordova-plugin-bbd-base
```
